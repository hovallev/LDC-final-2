LDC SPRING 2025

Or helping people push the frontier of their
competence and therefore having to
experience the loss of competence and
the experience of shame or the loss of
pride in their competency. Frequently in
leadership you are trying to build new
capacity and that means then you are
trying to bless incompetence and help
people feel more at home in learning
through version 1.0 to 2.0 through
failure and mistakes without
feeling embarrassed.

Professor, Harvard Kennedy School

Proposition VI
Both/and it with a paradox mindset.

When I consider conflicting perspectives, I gain a better understanding of an issue.
I am comfortable dealing with conflicting demands at the same time.
Accepting contradictions is essential for my success.
Tension between ideas energizes me.
I enjoy it when I manage to pursue contradictory goals.
I often experience myself as simultaneously embracing conflicting demands.
I am comfortable working on tasks that contradict each other.
I feel uplifted when I realize that two opposites can be true.
I feel energized when I manage to address contradictory issues.

PRACTICE G: SLOW DOWN TO SPEED UP

"When a machine is paused, it stops.
When each of us pause, we begin.”
Dov Seidman (founder, HOW Institute)

Negative capability: being in

and reason.” John Keats

“The greatest weapon against stress
is our ability to choose one thought
over another.” William James

PRACTICE J: DECISIVELY HEDGE
Take action but leave room for iteration by
running a controlled experiment. Think
about the following prompts:
• What is the simplest way to do something
like what you hope to do? How do you
make it simpler? Even simpler?

The Discipline of Experimentation

When you test, you never know for
sure, so like a good scientist have a …
H ypothesis (what you expect will
happen)

• Who has done something similar? How
can you learn from them?

O bjective (the purpose of your test)

• If you had no money but an insane
amount of frequent flier miles, where
would go?

E xecution Plan (that allows you to
track & measure)

P rediction (as specific as possible)

TOOL 2: ASSOCIATIVE THINKING GUIDE
Pick a problem with which you are wrestling with or an
industry in which you are interested. Do one or more of the
following:
•

Close your eyes for a minute and let your mind wander.
Where does it go?

Reflection questions

• How did you feel going through
the exercise?

• Which specific exercise was the
hardest? Why?

•

Think of images that connect to the problem or industry

•

Create a playlist of songs related to the problem or
industry

• What uncommon connections

Think of movie or show references that connect to the
problem or industry

• What might you do to more

•

This exercise can be done individually or in small groups.
Regular practice will strengthen your subconscious
muscles!

did you make?

regularly practice associational
thinking?

25

LDC SPRING 2025

TOOL 3: USE HISTORY AS BALLAST OR CATALYST FOR CHANGE
History can be an anchor that holds you back …
OR ballast that provides a foundation through change
AND a catalyst that enables new possibilities
Ways to rethink time
•

Develop ways to allow studying the past (e.g., a museum)

•

Break your historical identity into pieces … who, what,
where, how, why, when …

•

Identify parts of the historical identity that provide sources
of continuity

•

Look 25+ years in the future to see hidden opportunities
and challenges

•

Develop tools to understand how early-stage
developments could turn into market-changing disruptions
(e.g., prediction markets)

26

LDC SPRING 2025

TOOL 4: ADAPTIVE CHALLENGE CHECKLIST
Disruption is an adaptive challenge
1. In business, gravity
pulls you up, not
down

2. Disruptors do it
differently – trading
off pure performance
in the name of simplicity and affordability
3. Disruptors tend to start in protected markets …
studying the periphery helps to spot it early
4. Powerful business models propel disruptive
innovators to success
5. Disrupters take advantage of asymmetries. They
want to do what the incumbent doesn’t want to.

Three characteristics of adaptive
challenges:
1. There is not a single best answer
(1,000s of choices … feels risky)
2. There is a possibility that someone
will lose (identity threat)
3. There is a certainty that people will
struggle (“bless incompetency”)
Adaptive challenges require unlearning
and managing the discomfort of change

Best practices
• Create a formal structure.

• Give it resources and
autonomy over local resourceallocation decisions.
• Have senior leadership
arbitrate disputes and bias
towards the new.
• Micromanage the link between
it and existing operations.
• Ensure stage-appropriate
metrics & incentives (learning
vs. earning).

In a 2024 Sloan Management Review article I provided
my view of Tool 10: Purposeful Play …
Make it safe for your teams to play around with new
technologies. Give them time, the tools, and maybe
some rough guidelines. But don’t set specific objectives
or demand specific outcomes. Let them explore and
have fun. Do it with them. Screw up. Smile. Share. You’ll
be surprised by what you learn — and how it makes you
hungry to learn more. It will serve you well as you
navigate today’s disruptive times.

35

LDC SPRING 2025

TOOL 11: FAIR PROCESS

Fair process
A decision-making approach that
addresses our basic human
need to be valued and
respected. When people feel a
decision affecting them was
made fairly, they trust and
cooperate with manages. They
share ideas and willingly go
beyond the call of duty.
Corporate performance soars.

36

LDC SPRING 2025

TOOL 12: TIPS FOR RUNNING REFLECTIONS
Provide the following instructions to the group:
•
•
•
•
•

If you want to be recognized, raise your hand and wait until you are called on to speak
You can speak once, and only once. You don’t have to speak.
My job as a facilitator is simply to manage the room, not to comment on everyone’s reflection.
There isn’t a time limit for an individual reflection, but of course be conscious of your colleagues’
time
A reflection does not have to build on what has been discussed before. It can of course be inspired by
someone else’s reflection but feel free to share disconnected thoughts or even other associations
that enter your brain, like a scene in a movie or a song lyric.

The most important guidance to facilitators that have been consultants is the third point. It is very hard
when you are used to being hypothesis driven and finding the “so what” to not try to synthesize things,
comment on what’s said, seek to find connections, and more. That gets in the way of the exercise. Close
the exercise with two words. “Thank you.”

37

LDC SPRING 2025

TOOL 13: PREMORTEMS
Gather a group involved in an initiative. Discuss the
following questions:

• What are we excited about?
• What are we worried about?
• What would failure look like?
• What would spectacular failure look like?

• What would cause us to miss key deadlines?
• How have similar efforts struggled?
• What can we learn from them?
• What do we need that we don’t have?
• What do we have that we don’t need?

Reflection questions

• What is the most critical

assumptions that you uncovered?

• How can you learn more about it?
• What risk is more prominent than
you realized?

• Are there things you can do to
mitigate it?

• What was the balance between
internal and external factors?

Amy Edmonson on TOOL 14 …
psychological safety:
• “Psychological safety is defined as a
belief that you can speak up candidly
about work, relevant content, ideas,
questions, dissenting views, and yes,
even errors.”

• “Learning happens when you are able to
take risks, when you're able to stretch a
little bit to say something, even if you're
not 100% sure, or even 50% sure that it's
right, or that it’s helpful.”
• “I think at our best, our classrooms are
psychologically safe. They are learning
environments, they are environments
where people understand the difference
between an environment where you're
there to learn, versus an environment
where you're there to perform.”

something where there is
room for improvement.

Don’t worry about what you
should do, just what you are
doing.

How does this commitment
protect you? Ask, “And then
what would happen?”

Imagine doing the opposite
of undermining behaviors.
How would you feel?

TOOL 22: HOW TO DEVELOP A PARADOX MINDSET
Is a paradox mindset good? Research shows in situations where there are tensions, it provides clear benefits. It is,
in my view, a critical component of being a wise, decisive leader because your life will teem with tensions.
Are there downsides to it? Of course. There’s nothing that doesn’t have a downside. See the optional reading for
Thursday for one possible one.
Does everyone in the organizations you work with need to have it? Of course not. Managing the present, running
the core engine, sustaining innovations generally don’t require it. But creating the future, driving Transformation B,
disrupting, swimming in a blue ocean, managing adaptive change … does.
How do I build my paradox mindset?
• Go on a paradox quest. Purposefully do something against type. New experiences provide new frames and
perspectives.
• Shift perspectives. Take on a different persona. Shift your time frame. If you are in a big company imagine being
in a startup. If you are in a startup company imagine being in a big one. Use AI to help!
• Do thought experiments where you purposefully impose or remove constraints. What if money wasn’t an object?
What if you had zero dollars? What if you were barred from selling your core product?
• Refer back to the paradox mindset inventory. When you have what feels like a paradoxical problem read the
statements out loud. It feels corny, but it works.
